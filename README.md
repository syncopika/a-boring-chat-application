# funTalk
a basic chat application using Node.js, Socket.IO 
    
nothing to see yet. currently learning PHP and MySQL to see if I can get this to work the way I would like.   
    
The really cool feature that I think will make my application different from any other chat application out there is the fact that users will be able to preset emotions (i.e. happy, angry, sad) mapped to a variety of pictures and ASCII emoticons. That way when you're chatting and just words won't do, you don't have to search online for a particular ASCII emoticon or an anime reaction face to suit your needs. 
     
Ideally, users should be able to login with a username and password and customize their presets, which includes the ability to import new pictures. Therefore, maintaining a simple database will be necessary.
