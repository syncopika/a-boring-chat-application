# funTalk
a basic chat application using Node.js, Socket.IO 
    
nothing to see yet. currently learning PHP and MySQL to see if I can get this to work the way I would like.   
    
the really cool feature that I think will make my application different from any other chat application out there is the fact that users will be able to preset emotions (i.e. happy, angry, sad) mapped to a variety of pictures and ASCII emoticons. 
     
ideally, users should be able to login with a username and password and customize their presets, which includes the ability to import new pictures. therefore, maintaining a simple database will be necessary.
