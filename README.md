# funTalk
a basic chat application using Node.js, Socket.IO 
    
Initially I thought of using Node.js with PHP and MySQL, but I think now I better understand the purpose of these technologies and realize that using PHP here probably doesn't make much sense. All I really need to do is set up a server and a database. Since Node.js can already set up a server and can be used to talk to databases, I think that's all I need. I just need to set up my database. I think I might try out MongoDB for this, but MySQL is fun too (a little painful to set up though).    
    
The really cool feature that I think will make my application different from any other chat application out there is the fact that users will be able to preset emotions (i.e. happy, angry, sad) mapped to a variety of pictures and ASCII emoticons. That way when you're chatting and just words won't do, you don't have to search online for a particular ASCII emoticon or an anime reaction face to suit your needs. 
     
Ideally, users should be able to login with a username and password and customize their presets, which includes the ability to import new pictures. Therefore, maintaining a simple database will be necessary.
